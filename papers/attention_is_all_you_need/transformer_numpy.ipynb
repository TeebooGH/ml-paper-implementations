    "### Why this paper ?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook marks my first implementation of a research paper, and a Machine Learning one at that!\n",
    "AIAYN is a foundational research paper in NLP because of its breakthroughs and the consequences it had on modern (Late 2025) AI applications.\n",
    "I find NLP very fascinating, especially considering how relatively simple linear algebra formulae have had such an impact on our daily lives - That's why I choose this paper for my first research paper implementation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why implement this using only NumPy ?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm very passionate about mathematics, especially how elegant reasoning can be applied to real-world problems.\n",
    "I like giving sense to the abstract equations I've learnt about through my studies, and NumPy gives me an occasion to computationally translate \"pure\" math equations to a supercalculator, isn't that cool?\n"
